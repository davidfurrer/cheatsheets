The :moon: is an astronomical body that orbits the Earth as its only permanent natural satellite. :it: is the fifth-largest :satellite: in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that :it: orbits (its primary). The :moon: is, after Jupiter's :satellite: Io, the second-densest :satellite: in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.
The :moon: is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that the :moon: formed from the debris left over after :a: giant impact between Earth and :a: Mars-sized body called Theia. :new: research of :moon: rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the :moon: may be older than previously thought.The :moon: is in synchronous rotation with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the near side. The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. After the Sun, the :moon: is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky :it: appears very bright, with :a: reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the :ocean: tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.
