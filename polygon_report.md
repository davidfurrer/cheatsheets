# Polygon Research Report

## Technology

Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees. It uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and is built on top of the Ethereum network. Polygon is designed to be compatible with existing Ethereum tools and infrastructure, making it easy for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on the network.

## Adoption

Polygon has seen significant adoption since its launch in 2017. As of April 2023, there are over 1,500 dApps built on the Polygon network, with over 7 million unique users and over $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) in the network. Some of the most popular dApps on the network include Aave, SushiSwap, and Curve Finance.

## KPIs

Some of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for Polygon include:

- Number of dApps built on the network
- Number of unique users
- Total value locked (TVL) in the network
- Transaction volume

## Business Development

Polygon has formed partnerships with a number of companies and projects in the blockchain space, including:

- Chainlink
- Curve Finance
- Aave
- SushiSwap
- 0x

These partnerships have helped to increase the adoption and visibility of the Polygon network.

## Team

Polygon was founded by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun in 2017. The team has since grown to include over 100 members, with offices in India, the United States, and Europe. The team has a strong background in blockchain technology and has worked on a number of successful projects in the past.

## Potential

Polygon has the potential to become a major player in the blockchain space, particularly in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi). Its focus on scalability and low transaction fees make it an attractive option for developers looking to build dApps on the Ethereum network. As the demand for DeFi applications continues to grow, Polygon is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
